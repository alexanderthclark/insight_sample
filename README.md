This repository houses selections from my Insight project.


### data_assembly
*data_assembly.py* pulls EPA data from the web on daily levels of pollution and temperature and time use data from the BLS.

I've set the defaults in the file to download less data than I used for my project. This is done for speed.

See https://www.bls.gov/tus/ for additional documentation on the American Time Use Survey.

See https://www.ipums.org/ for more ATUS data files.
